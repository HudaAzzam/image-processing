#  Edge Detection: Sobel vs. Canny

## Overview
This repository explores **edge detection** using two widely used techniques: **Sobel** and **Canny**. The goal is to compare their performance and understand their differences.

- **Sobel**: A simple gradient-based method for detecting edges.
- **Canny**: A more advanced algorithm that includes noise reduction, edge thinning, and thresholding.

This project is part of my **learning journey** in image processing.
